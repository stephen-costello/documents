Project Title: Suggested Actions Application Scope Document

1. Introduction:
The Suggested Actions Application, integrated into the desktop application ADE (Application for Desktop Environment), is designed to provide intelligent recommendations and actions to users within the ADE environment. It consists of an Experience API and a front-end UI that aims to streamline user interactions and improve their overall experience.

2. Objectives:
The primary objectives of the Suggested Actions Application within ADE are as follows:

Deliver context-aware recommendations and actions to users based on their ongoing tasks and activities.
Provide a clear and user-friendly interface for users to view and interact with recommendations.
Enhance user productivity by simplifying common tasks and providing helpful resources when needed.
3. Features:

3.1 Landing Page:

Display a landing page with a "Recommendations" header.
Depending on the recommendations status (0 or 1), the landing page will vary.
3.2 Recommendations:

If recommendations are 0:
Display a header with "Recommendations 0" highlighted in grey.
Display body text: "We don't have any recommendations for this participant right now. But you can choose from available actions."
Provide a header for "Helpful Resources" in bold.
Include links to:
Associate Benefits Library (ABL)
AgentBOT
3.3 Recommendations:

If recommendations are 1:
Display a tile for password reset with an arrow.
If the password reset tile is clicked:
Navigate to a new page with a "Back" link.
Display a bold header for "Password Reset."
Include a subheader for "Instructions."
Provide a link to "Search AgentBOT for Password Reset."
To the right, display a header for "Tools."
Display each of these tools with a tick box to the left:
Xtrac's Tool
Username & Password Reset
Outbound Email Tool
Customer Web View
Customer Web View - Mobile
NetBenefits Login Page
Include a "Launch" button under the tools.
Only tools with ticked checkboxes will be launched in new windows.
4. Scope Limitations:

The Suggested Actions Application will focus solely on providing recommendations, actions, and tools within the ADE environment.
It will not access external data sources or perform actions outside of the ADE application.
5. Deliverables:
The following deliverables are expected as a result of this project:

Functional Suggested Actions Application integrated into ADE.
User documentation explaining how to interact with and customize suggested actions.
