Activities | Domain API | POST - Data Stored in PostgreSQL Database:
Scenario: Verify data is stored in PostgreSQL database after a successful POST request
Given the API endpoint is available
And the API is connected to the PostgreSQL database
And the database is empty
When a POST request is sent with valid data in the request body
And the request headers are valid (e.g., accept, FID-LOG-TRACKING-ID, Authorization, FID-WS-PRINIPAL-ROLE, FID-USER-ID-TYPE, FID-USER-ID, Content-type)
Then the response code should be 200
And the response data should be valid

And after a reasonable delay (to allow for data storage in the database)
When a query is performed in the PostgreSQL database using relevant information from the API request (e.g., user ID, session ID, etc.)
Then the data posted in the request should be found in the database
And the retrieved data from the database should match the data posted in the request

Note: In this test case, we are verifying that the data sent in the POST request is successfully stored in the PostgreSQL database after receiving a 200 response from the API. We perform a query in the database using relevant information from the API request (e.g., user ID, session ID, etc.) to ensure that the data is properly stored and retrievable.
