Project Title: NewsLine - News Feed Tool Scope Document

1. Introduction:
NewsLine is a web-based news feed tool designed to provide users with access to daily news articles, as well as an archive of past articles. This tool aims to deliver a user-friendly experience by displaying current news, article summaries, and easy navigation to full articles and archives.

2. Objectives:
The primary objectives of the NewsLine tool are as follows:

Display today's news in a user-friendly format.
Provide a view of article descriptions, publication dates, brief summaries, and "Read More" links.
Indicate whether articles have been read or not through green borders.
Allow users to access full articles within the same screen (single page).
Enable users to access archived articles using a date picker.
Offer navigation to return to today's news from the archives.
3. Features:

3.1 Today's News Section:

Display a header titled "Today's News" with the month, day, and year.
Include a "View Archives" link for accessing past articles.
3.2 Article Display:

Each article in today's news will contain the following:
A green, bolded article description.
Day, date, and time of publication.
A brief summary of the article.
A "Read More" link to access the full article.
Articles that have not been read will have a green border around the outside.
3.3 Full Article View:

When a user clicks the "Read More" link, the full article will open within the same screen (single page).
A "Back" button will be provided for returning to the main news feed.
3.4 Archive View:

Clicking the "View Archives" link will open a date picker for selecting a specific date to view archived articles.
