1. Introduction
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the robustness and security of the PlanViewer mobile application by testing the implementation of password harvesting and the details link feature. This testing will encompass both functional and regression testing across various environments, including Systems Integration (SIT), User Acceptance (UAT), Staging, and Production.

2. Scope
2.1 Functional Testing
Password Harvesting:

Validate the functionality of the password harvesting feature to ensure it securely captures and stores user credentials.
Verify that passwords are encrypted and stored in a secure manner.
Test the retrieval process to confirm the accurate fetching of stored passwords.
Details Link Integration:

Evaluate the integration of the details link feature within the PlanViewer application.
Confirm that the details link seamlessly connects to the relevant information and displays it accurately.
2.2 Regression Testing
Previous Functionality:
Verify that existing functionalities of the PlanViewer application are unaffected by the implementation of password harvesting and details link features.
3. Test Environments
3.1 Systems Integration (SIT)
Execute comprehensive test scenarios in the SIT environment to ensure the smooth integration of the new features with existing components.
Validate end-to-end functionality and assess system behavior under various simulated conditions.
Conduct positive and negative test cases to evaluate the robustness of the password harvesting and details link features.
3.2 User Acceptance (UAT)
Collaborate with end-users to conduct user acceptance testing, ensuring the features align with user expectations and requirements.
Collect feedback on the usability and security aspects of password harvesting, incorporating any necessary adjustments.
3.3 Staging
Conduct a final round of testing in the staging environment to validate the stability and performance of the application.
Verify that the password harvesting and details link features operate seamlessly in an environment closely resembling the production setup.
3.4 Production
Perform a controlled rollout of the new features in the production environment.
Monitor system performance, security, and user feedback to address any issues promptly.
4. Test Deliverables
Test Cases: Detailed test cases covering all aspects of password harvesting and details link integration.
Test Execution Reports: Comprehensive reports on test execution, including pass/fail status and any issues encountered.
User Feedback Summary: Compilation of user feedback from UAT, addressing any concerns or suggestions.
5. Conclusion
This XRAY test plan aims to ensure the successful implementation of password harvesting and details link features in the PlanViewer mobile application. By conducting thorough functional and regression testing across various environments, we aim to guarantee a secure, reliable, and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.
