o implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests for all the scenarios described in the document, we will use the Cucumber framework, which allows us to write test scenarios in a natural language format that is easily understandable by stakeholders and developers. Each scenario will be written as a Gherkin feature file, and the steps in the scenarios will be mapped to corresponding test steps in the automation code.

Let's outline the BDD test scenarios for the API:

Scenario: Successful GET Request with Valid JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: Successful GET Request with Valid JWT Token and FIDREP Header
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 200
  And the JSON response should contain "name" and "address" fields
Scenario: Successful GET Request with Empty Response

Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: Successful GET Request with Empty Response
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  And the database returns an empty response
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 204
  And the JSON response should be empty
Scenario: GET Request with Missing JWT Token

Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Missing JWT Token
  Given a request is made without a JWT token
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 400
Scenario: GET Request with Invalid JWT Token

Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Invalid JWT Token
  Given a request is made with an invalid JWT token
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 401
Scenario: GET Request with Expired JWT Token

Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Expired JWT Token
  Given a request is made with an expired JWT token
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 401
Scenario: GET Request with Invalid FIDREP Header

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Invalid FIDREP Header
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And an invalid FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 400
Scenario: GET Request with Unauthorized FIDREP Header

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Unauthorized FIDREP Header
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And an unauthorized FIDREP header value is set
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 401
Scenario: GET Request with Database Error

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Database Error
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  And the database encounters an error
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 500
Scenario: GET Request with Resource Not Found

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: GET Request with Resource Not Found
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set
  And the requested resource is not found in the database
  When a GET request is sent to the API endpoint
  Then the response code should be 404
These are the BDD test scenarios for the API, described using Gherkin language. The corresponding step definitions and automation code will be written to implement these scenarios using Cucumber and the preferred programming language (e.g., Java, JavaScript) for the test automation framework. The BDD tests will ensure that the API behaves as expected and adheres to the specified requirements throughout its development and future enhancements.

Scenario: Successful POST Request with Valid JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Feature: API Endpoint Authorization with JWT Token and FIDREP Header

Scenario: Successful POST Request with Valid JWT Token and FIDREP Header
  Given a valid JWT token is generated for a user
  And a valid FIDREP header value is set

  Then the response code should be 201
  And the JSON response should contain the message "New entry created successfully."
