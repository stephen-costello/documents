Scope Document: Building a GET and POST Request for JSON Response from PostgreSQL Database with JWT Token and FIDREP Headers

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop an API with both GET and POST request endpoints. The API will allow users to retrieve name and address information from a PostgreSQL database using a GET request. Additionally, users can create a new entry with name and address information in the database using a POST request. To ensure security, the API will require two headers to be passed in the requests - a JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication token as the "Authorization" header and a custom header "FIDREP" for additional authentication purposes. The API should also handle various response codes to ensure robustness and reliability. Furthermore, the API will support filtering the data based on a time range of either 2 days or 7 days in the GET request endpoint.

Functional Requirements:
The API should provide the following functionalities:

2.1. GET Endpoint:
The API should have a GET endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests.

2.2. POST Endpoint:
The API should have a POST endpoint that accepts HTTP POST requests.

2.3. Request Headers:
The API should require two headers in the requests for authentication:

"Authorization": To pass the JWT token for authentication.
"FIDREP": To provide additional authentication data.
Example Request Headers:

makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
FIDREP: <Some_Value>
2.4. Request Parameters for GET:
The API should accept an optional query parameter for filtering the data based on a time range of either 2 days or 7 days.

Example Request URL for 2-day filter:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/data?days=2
Example Request URL for 7-day filter:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/data?days=7
2.5. Request Body for POST:
The API should accept a JSON request body for creating a new entry with name and address information in the database.

Example POST Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "123 Main Street, Cityville, State, Country"
}
2.6. Response Format:
The API should retrieve the name and address information from the PostgreSQL database based on the specified time range in the GET request and return a JSON response containing the following information:

Name: The name of the individual or organization.
Address: The postal address associated with the name.
Example JSON Response for GET:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "123 Main Street, Cityville, State, Country"
}
For the POST request, the API should return a JSON response confirming the successful creation of the new entry.

Example JSON Response for POST:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "New entry created successfully."
}
Response Codes:
The API should handle the following response codes:
3.1. GET Request Response Codes:

200 OK: If the request is successful, and the name and address information are available in the PostgreSQL database, and the JWT token is valid along with the correct "FIDREP" header value, the API should return a 200 OK response code along with the JSON response.
204 No Content: If the request is successful, but no name and address information are found in the PostgreSQL database (empty response), and the JWT token is valid along with the correct "FIDREP" header value, the API should return a 204 No Content response code. The JSON response in this case will be empty.
400 Bad Request: If the request is malformed, contains invalid parameters, the JWT token is missing or invalid, the "FIDREP" header value is incorrect, or the specified time range is invalid, the API should return a 400 Bad Request response code.
401 Unauthorized: If the provided JWT token is not valid or has expired, or the "FIDREP" header value is incorrect, the API should return a 401 Unauthorized response code.
404 Not Found: If the requested resource (name and address information) is not found in the PostgreSQL database, and the JWT token is valid along with the correct "FIDREP" header value, the API should return a 404 Not Found response code.
500 Internal Server Error: If an unexpected error occurs while querying the PostgreSQL database or validating the JWT token, the API should return a 500 Internal Server Error response code.
3.2. POST Request Response Codes:

201 Created: If the POST request to create a new entry is successful, and the JWT token is valid along with the correct "FIDREP" header value, the API should return a 201 Created response code along with the JSON response confirming the successful creation of the new entry.
400 Bad Request: If the POST request is malformed or contains invalid parameters, the JWT token is missing or invalid, or the "FIDREP" header value is incorrect, the API should return a 400 Bad Request response code.
401 Unauthorized: If the provided JWT token is not valid or has expired, or the "FIDREP" header value is incorrect, the API should return a 401 Unauthorized response code.
500 Internal Server Error: If an unexpected error occurs while processing the POST request, the API should return a 500 Internal Server Error response code.
Non-functional Requirements:
4.1. Security:
The API should be designed to handle potential security concerns, including input validation, data sanitization, and proper handling of both JWT token and "FIDREP" header for authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
4.2. Performance:
The API should be optimized for performance to handle a reasonable number of concurrent requests without significant delays. The database queries should be efficiently designed to ensure quick responses.

4.3. Scalability:
The API should be designed in a way that allows for easy scalability to accommodate future growth in the number of users and data volume. The database should be scalable to handle increased data storage requirements.

4.4. Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling mechanisms should be implemented to provide meaningful error messages in the JSON response, especially when database-related errors occur or authentication fails.

4.5. API Documentation:
Clear and detailed API documentation should be provided to assist developers in understanding the API's capabilities, usage, and the procedure to obtain and use the JWT token and "FIDREP" header for authentication.

Technology Stack:
The following technology stack is proposed for the implementation of the API:
Programming Language: [Choose the preferred language, e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.]
Web Framework: [Choose the preferred framework, e.g., Flask, Express, etc.]
JSON Serialization/Deserialization Library: [Choose the preferred library, e.g., json module in Python]
Database: PostgreSQL [version]
Database Library/ORM: [Choose the preferred library, e.g., psycopg2 for Python]
JWT Authentication Library: [Choose the preferred library, e.g., jsonwebtoken for Python/Node.js]
Testing:
Comprehensive testing will be conducted to ensure the correctness and reliability of the API.
6.1. Unit Testing:
Unit tests will be developed to verify the functionality of individual components and functions within the API. Mocking will be used to isolate dependencies such as database interactions.

6.2. End-to-End Testing with Karate Framework:
End-to-end testing will be performed
