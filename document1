Scope Document: Building a GET Request for JSON Response

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a GET request API endpoint that will return a JSON response containing name and address information. The API should be designed to handle various response codes to ensure robustness and reliability.

Functional Requirements:
The API should provide the following functionalities:

2.1. Endpoint:
The API should have a single endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests.

2.2. Request Parameters:
No request parameters are required for this API; it will be a simple GET request without any query parameters.

2.3. Response Format:
The API should return a JSON response containing the following information:

Name: The name of the individual or organization.
Address: The postal address associated with the name.
Example JSON Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "123 Main Street, Cityville, State, Country"
}
Response Codes:
The API should handle the following response codes:
3.1. 200 OK:
If the request is successful, and the name and address information are available, the API should return a 200 OK response code along with the JSON response.

3.2. 204 No Content:
If the request is successful, but no name and address information are available (empty response), the API should return a 204 No Content response code. The JSON response in this case will be empty.

3.3. 400 Bad Request:
If the request is malformed or contains invalid parameters, the API should return a 400 Bad Request response code.

3.4. 404 Not Found:
If the requested resource (name and address information) is not found, the API should return a 404 Not Found response code.

3.5. 500 Internal Server Error:
If an unexpected error occurs on the server-side, the API should return a 500 Internal Server Error response code.

Non-functional Requirements:
4.1. Security:
The API should be designed to handle potential security concerns, such as input validation and data sanitization, to prevent any malicious activities.
4.2. Performance:
The API should be optimized for performance to handle a reasonable number of concurrent requests without significant delays.

4.3. Scalability:
The API should be designed in a way that allows for easy scalability to accommodate future growth in the number of users and data volume.

4.4. Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling mechanisms should be implemented to provide meaningful error messages in the JSON response.

4.5. API Documentation:
Clear and detailed API documentation should be provided to assist developers in understanding the API's capabilities and usage.

Technology Stack:
The following technology stack is proposed for the implementation of the API:
Programming Language: [Choose the preferred language, e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.]
Web Framework: [Choose the preferred framework, e.g., Flask, Express, etc.]
JSON Serialization/Deserialization Library: [Choose the preferred library, e.g., json module in Python]
Deployment: [Choose the preferred platform, e.g., Docker, AWS, etc.]
Testing:
Comprehensive unit testing and integration testing should be conducted to ensure the correctness and reliability of the API.

Project Timeline:
The estimated project timeline for implementing the API and performing testing is [Provide an estimated timeline].

Note: The above scope document serves as a starting point for the project and may be subject to further refinement based on discussions and specific project requirements.
