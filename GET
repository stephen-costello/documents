Activities | Domain API | GET - RESPONSE CODE 200:
Scenario: Valid GET request with all required headers
Given the API endpoint is available
When a GET request is sent with valid headers (accept, FID-LOG-TRACKING, Authorisation, FID-PRINCIPAL-ROLE, FID-USER-TYPE, FID-USER-ID, FID-LOG-SESSION)
Then the response code should be 200
And the response data should be valid

Activities | Domain API | GET - RESPONSE CODE 401:
Scenario: Unauthorized access due to missing or invalid authorization header
Given the API endpoint is available
When a GET request is sent without or with an invalid Authorisation header
Then the response code should be 401
And the response message should indicate "Unauthorized"

Activities | Domain API | GET - RESPONSE CODE 404:
Scenario: Requested resource not found
Given the API endpoint is available
When a GET request is sent to a non-existent endpoint/resource
Then the response code should be 404
And the response message should indicate "Not Found"

Activities | Domain API | GET - RESPONSE CODE 400:
Scenario: Bad Request due to missing or invalid parameters
Given the API endpoint is available
When a GET request is sent with missing or invalid parameters
Then the response code should be 400
And the response message should indicate "Bad Request"

Activities | Domain API | GET - RESPONSE CODE 403:
Scenario: Forbidden access
Given the API endpoint is available
When a GET request is sent with valid headers, but the user is not allowed to access the resource
Then the response code should be 403
And the response message should indicate "Forbidden"

These test cases cover various scenarios related to response codes 200, 401, 404, 400, and 403 for the API's GET request with specific headers. Remember to adapt these test cases based on the actual requirements and specifics of the API you are testing.
