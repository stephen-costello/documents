Scenario 4: Handling Password Reset Request with Blank Cosmo Semantic Tag and 'Pin Status' BLK, BST, or BRS
Given the user has accessed the Modernised Associate Desktop Experience (ADE)
And the user plays the role of "customer"
When the user calls the environment phone line via the Genesys call system
And the customer gives a whisper to the system of "password reset"
And the Cosmo semantic tag in the data in the global store is blank
And the 'pin status' is either BLK (Blocked), BST (Temporary Blocked), or BRS (Reset)
Then the Suggested Actions application should be in the same state as described in "Agent Processes Password Reset Request via Suggested Actions Application" scenario:
Given the agent has received the call from the customer
And the agent opens the Suggested Actions application
And the Cosmo semantic tag in the data in the global store is still blank, but the 'pin status' is BLK, BST, or BRS
When the Suggested Actions application reads the 'pin status'
Then a section with the header 'recommendations 1' should appear on the Suggested Actions application
And a new tile under the header of 'password reset' should appear
And the source on the tile should be 'whisper'
Given the agent sees the 'password reset' tile with the source 'whisper' on the Suggested Actions application
When the agent clicks the 'password reset' tile
Then the agent should navigate to the password reset page
And the agent should see a list of tools and actions related to password reset
