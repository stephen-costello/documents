Scenario 1: Navigating to the Search Page
Given the user is logged into the ADE desktop application
When the user navigates to the search page
Then they should see a tab specifically for activities

Scenario 2: Viewing Recent Activities on the Search Page
Given the user is on the activities tab of the search page
When they view the page
Then they should see a list of recent activities
And each activity should display a timestamp, participant name, plan ID, and plan name

Scenario 3: Clicking on an Activity to View Participant Banner
Given the user is on the activities tab of the search page
When they click on a specific activity
Then they should be taken to the participant banner of that activity

Scenario 4: Ending Session on Participant Banner
Given the user is on the participant banner of a specific activity
When they select the "End Session" button
Then the session should be closed
And a new activity should appear in the activities model



Objective:
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the robustness, reliability, and functionality of the "myActivities" feature within the ADE (Application for Phone Reps) desktop application. The testing will cover various scenarios related to navigating the search page, viewing recent activities, interacting with participant banners, and validating the behavior of ending sessions.

Features to be Tested:
Navigation to Search Page:

Verify that users can successfully navigate to the search page from the ADE desktop application.
Confirm the existence of a dedicated tab for "myActivities" on the search page.
Viewing Recent Activities:

Confirm that recent activities are displayed on the activities tab.
Validate the presence of essential information such as timestamp, participant name, plan ID, and plan name for each activity.
Clicking on an Activity:

Ensure that users can click on a specific activity to view the participant banner.
Verify that the transition from the activities tab to the participant banner is seamless.
Ending Session on Participant Banner:

Validate that the "End Session" button on the participant banner closes the current session.
Confirm the appearance of a new activity in the activities model after ending a session.
Test Scenarios:
Navigation and Tab Verification:

Given a logged-in user in the ADE desktop application,
When the user navigates to the search page,
Then they should observe the presence of a dedicated tab for "myActivities."
Recent Activities Display:

Given the user is on the "myActivities" tab of the search page,
When the user views the page,
Then recent activities should be displayed with accurate timestamp, participant name, plan ID, and plan name.
Activity Click and Participant Banner:

Given the user is on the "myActivities" tab,
When the user clicks on a specific activity,
Then they should be seamlessly directed to the participant banner of that activity.
Ending Session and New Activity:

Given the user is on the participant banner of a specific activity,
When the user selects the "End Session" button,
Then the session should be closed,
And a new activity should promptly appear in the activities model.
