est Plan: May 23rd - May 29th, 2024

Objective: To ensure the quality and readiness of the latest ADE build through comprehensive testing, including sanity checks, functional testing, defect detection, and stress testing.

Schedule and Activities:
May 23rd, 2024
DIT Sanity Testing:

Time: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
Team: QE squad
Description: Conduct back-to-back calls to sanity test the latest ADE build and help determine FAC readiness.
Goal: Ensure basic functionality and stability of the build.
FAC Sanity Testing:

Time: 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM
Team: QE squad
Description: Conduct back-to-back calls to sanity test the latest ADE build.
Goal: Verify functionality and stability specifically for FAC.
May 24th - May 26th, 2024
Back-to-Back and Functional Testing:

Time: Continuous (24 hours)
Team: Global QE team
Description: Conduct back-to-back testing sessions targeting high priority defects, updating test case statuses and bugs.
Goal: Identify and resolve high priority defects, ensure functional integrity.
Baseline Testing Automation:

Time: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (Onshore team)
Team: Onshore QE team
Description: Generate a large volume of calls on a 32GB laptop. Teams should be out of FAC and off Genesys to avoid disturbing calls.
Goal: Establish a performance baseline under high load conditions.
Functional / Back-to-Back Calls / Defect Detection:

Time: Continuous (24 hours)
Teams: US, India, Ireland QE teams
Description: Execute functional and back-to-back calls around the clock to increase functional coverage and keep defect detection up to date.
Goal: Increase functional coverage and maintain current defect detection.
May 27th, 2024
Stopwatch Testing:

Time: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (India team) / 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM (US team)
Teams: India and US QE teams
Description: Conduct stopwatch testing on 16GB and 32GB configurations.
Goal: Measure and verify response times and performance metrics.
Longevity Test:

Time: 3:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Team: Global QE team
Description: Kick off Mox longevity test, including B2B testing.
Goal: Assess system stability over an extended period under continuous load.
May 28th, 2024
Baseline 2 Testing:
Time: 7:00 PM - 11:00 PM (After hours, US time)
Team: Onshore QE team
Description: Conduct a second baseline test to verify performance under consistent conditions.
Goal: Validate performance consistency compared to the first baseline test.
May 29th, 2024
Stress Test:
Time: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
Team: Global QE team
Description: Complete 60 calls in 1 hour with no force exit scenarios.
Goal: Test system endurance and reliability under high call volume.
Responsibilities:
QE Squad: Conduct DIT and FAC sanity testing.
Global QE Team: Perform back-to-back testing, functional testing, stopwatch testing, longevity testing, and stress testing.
Onshore QE Team: Execute baseline testing automation and Baseline 2 testing.
US, India, Ireland Teams: Collaborate on continuous functional and defect detection testing.
Deliverables:
Test Case Status Reports: Daily updates on test case execution and defect status.
Defect Reports: Detailed reports on defects identified during testing.
Performance Metrics: Results from stopwatch testing, baseline tests, and stress tests.
Longevity Test Results: Summary of system stability and performance over the test period.
Communication Plan:
Daily Stand-Up Meetings: 9:00 AM local time for each team to discuss progress and issues.
End-of-Day Reports: Summarized testing activities and outcomes.
Defect Review Meetings: As needed, based on defect discovery and priority.
Tools and Environment:
Testing Tools: Automation scripts, stopwatch tools, performance monitoring tools.
Environment: 32GB laptops for baseline tests, 16GB and 32GB configurations for stopwatch tests, and global test environments for functional and longevity tests.
By following this detailed test plan, the QE teams will ensure a thorough assessment of the latest ADE build, focusing on both functional integrity and performance under various conditions.
