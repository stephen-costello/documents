As a user,
I want to see a 'No activities found.' message and have the activities count displayed as zero for the selected time frame.

Scenario: Display message and zero count for no activities in the last 2 days
Given the user is on the 'My Activities' tab in the search module,
And the user has not recorded any activities in the last 2 days,
When the user clicks on the 'Last 2 days()' toggle,
Then the 'No activities found.' message displays on the top right,
And the activities count next to the 'Last 2 days()' toggle is zero.
Scenario: Display message and zero count for no activities in the last 7 days
Given the user is on the 'My Activities' tab in the search module,
And the user has not recorded any activities in the last 7 days,
When the user clicks on the 'Last 7 days()' toggle,
Then the 'No activities found.' message displays on the top right,
And the activities count next to the 'Last 7 days()' toggle is zero.
