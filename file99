Feature: Selecting an Archive Date and Returning to Today's News
Scenario: Navigating from Selected Archive Date Back to Today's News

Given the user has selected a date from the date picker in the NewsLine application,
When the user navigates back to the archive for that selected date,
Then a new link labeled 'Back to today' with an arrow to the left should be displayed,
And this link should be green and underlined.
When the user clicks on the 'Back to today' link,
Then the user should be returned to the 'Today's News' section of the NewsLine application.
This scenario ensures that users who have navigated to a specific date's archive have a clear, convenient way to return to the current day's news, enhancing the usability and navigation flow within the NewsLine application.
