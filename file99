As a user,
I want to have a record of each session ended with a participant, including relevant details and displayed in the correct order.

Scenario: End session and return to search module landing
Given the user has searched and found a participant in the search module,
And the participant banner is displayed indicating the participant is in context,
When the user selects the 'End Session' button on the controller,
Then the session with the participant ends,
And the user is returned to the search module landing page.
Scenario: Record of activity for ended session
Given the user has ended a session with a participant,
When the user checks the 'My Activities' tab,
Then there is a record of the activity for that participant,
And the activity includes details like Date/Time, Duration, Customer Name, Client Name, Plan ID.
Scenario: Activities ordered by newest to oldest
Given the user has multiple recorded activities,
When the user views the 'My Activities' tab,
Then the activities are displayed in the table ordered from newest to oldest based on the Date/Time stamp.
Scenario: Activity details match session information
Given the user has ended a session with a participant and the activity is recorded,
When the user views the details of the activity in the 'My Activities' tab,
Then the details such as Customer Name, Client Name, and Plan ID match those from the session,
And the Date/Time and Duration accurately reflect the session's timing and length.
