"Suggested Actions is an Angular application seamlessly integrated into the ADE environment, revealing its dynamic capabilities following a search or upon the display of the participant banner during a Genesys call. At its core, Suggested Actions operates in harmony with the global store, leveraging its extensive functionalities to discern key triggers such as 'password' reset whispers embedded within Cosmo Symantic tags or instances of blocked PIN statuses. When identified, Suggested Actions proactively generates recommendations for associates, guiding them towards the optimal utilization of password reset tools. This intuitive application enhances user efficiency, providing timely and actionable insights to address participant needs within the complex landscape of ADE."
