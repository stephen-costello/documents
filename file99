Feature: Disclaimer Page Navigation
In order to ensure the users understand and agree to the legal disclaimer before proceeding,
As a legal or compliance officer,
I want to make sure that users can only proceed after agreeing to the terms of the disclaimer.

Scenario 1: Viewing the disclaimer page
Given a user navigates to the disclaimer page,
Then they see a header with "Please read before continuing",
And a body of text stating "This is a legal disclaimer and will be read aloud",
And a tick box with the label "I agree to terms" to the left of it,
And a greyed-out "Next" button.

Scenario 2: Attempting to proceed without agreeing to the disclaimer
Given a user is on the disclaimer page,
When the tick box is not ticked,
Then the "Next" button remains greyed out,
And the user cannot proceed to the next page.

Scenario 3: Agreeing to the disclaimer
Given a user is on the disclaimer page,
When the user ticks the "I agree to terms" tick box,
Then the "Next" button becomes clickable.

Scenario 4: Proceeding after agreeing to the disclaimer
Given the "I agree to terms" tick box is ticked,
When the user clicks on the "Next" button,
Then the user is taken to the next page in the process.
