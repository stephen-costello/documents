Test Case 5: Display Message When No News Content is Available

Given the user is viewing the NewsLine application within ADE,
And there is no news available for the current day (e.g., July 4th) in either today's news or the archives,
When the user checks the news content for the current day,
Then NewsLine should display the message 'No content at this time.' directly under the 'View Archives' link.
