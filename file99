As a user,
I want to see my activities organized in a table with predefined headers.

Scenario: Activities table is correctly formatted with headers
Given the user is on the 'My Activities' tab where activities are present,
When the user views the activities,
Then the activities are displayed in a table format,
And the table includes the headers: "Date/Time," "Duration," "Customer Name," "Client Name," and "Plan ID."
Scenario: No activities present - table structure
Given the user is on the 'My Activities' tab but no activities have been recorded for the selected time frame,
When the user views the activities section,
Then the table structure is still displayed with the headers: "Date/Time," "Duration," "Customer Name," "Client Name," and "Plan ID",
And a message under the table headers indicates "No activities found."
Scenario: Display recorded activities in the table
Given the user has activities recorded within the selected time frame,
When the user views the activities,
Then each recorded activity is displayed in a row under the appropriate headers,
And each activity's details align under the headers "Date/Time," "Duration," "Customer Name," "Client Name," and "Plan ID."
