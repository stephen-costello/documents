As a user,
I want to click on a customer name to bring them back into context and manage the session accordingly, ensuring subsequent activities are accurately recorded.

Scenario: Recalling a participant from 'My Activities'
Given the user is viewing 'My Activities',
When the user clicks on the clickable link of a customer name,
Then that customer is displayed in context on the participant banner.
Scenario: Ending a session after recalling a participant
Given a participant has been recalled into context from 'My Activities',
When the user selects the 'End Session' button on the controller,
Then the user is returned to the search module landing page.
Scenario: Logging new activity for a recalled participant
Given a participant has been recalled and the session subsequently ended,
When the user checks 'My Activities',
Then there is a new activity record for that participant,
And this activity is the latest based on the timestamp, ensuring it appears at the top of the activities list if sorted by newest to oldest.
Scenario: Consistency and accuracy of activity records
Given a participant has been recalled to context and the session ended,
When the user views the new activity in 'My Activities',
Then the activity details accurately reflect the recent interaction,
And include Date/Time, Duration, Customer Name, Client Name, Plan ID,
And this new activity follows the ordering rule, placed as the most recent activity.
