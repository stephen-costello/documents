I, [Your Name], as the Quality Assurance representative, hereby sign off on the production release of the desktop application ADE's "My Activities" feature.

Testing for this release has been rigorously conducted across non-production environments, including Development Integration Testing (DIT) and Functional Acceptance Certification (FAC). Additionally, thorough testing was carried out in research mode (Search) and Incoming Call mode (Genesys).

Observations:

Plan details were found to be incorrect in the DIT environment, potentially due to a data issue, as this discrepancy was not reproducible in the FAC environment.

It was observed that "My Activities" functionality is dependent on the 'End Session' event. If this event is fired twice, duplicate records may be generated. Conversely, if the 'End Session' event is not fired, no record will be created.

In the pilot environment, it was noted that activity recording in 'Incoming Call' mode (Genesys) ceases after the 'End Session' event. However, this behavior was not reproducible in non-production environments.

Based on these observations and considering the overall testing outcomes, I deem the application ready for production release.

Signed,
