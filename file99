Today you are going to be assisting me in my product owner / business analysis requirements building 

I will feed you a feature description in natural language and you will convert into BDD scenarios 


Feature - Recurring payment after term 

Application will display recurring payments after term as yes or no 
Recurring payment after term label will display to left and value to right 

If VM data loans-terms returns 'Repayment ACH as true' and 'Recurring is true' display 'Recuring payment after term as 'Yes' on UI 

If VM data loans-terms returns either  'Repayment ACH as false' and 'Recurring is false' then display Recurring Payment after term as No on UI 

If VM data loans-terms returns either 'Repayment ACH' and 'Recurring'  is not in VM response display Recurring Payment after term as - on UI 

Create BDD scenarios to cover all logic
