As a user,
I want to log calls through the Call Logger app before ending the session, ensuring these interactions are recorded in 'My Activities'.

Scenario: Handling an incoming call while on the search and workspace is active
Given the user is on search and the workspace is active,
When a call comes in via the Genesys queue,
Then the participant is placed in context and the participant banner is displayed.
Scenario: Logging a call before ending the session
Given an incoming call is in progress and the participant banner is displayed,
When the user selects the 'End Session' button on the controller,
Then the Call Logger app appears,
And the user must log the call for the session to end.
Scenario: Return to search module landing after call logging
Given the user has logged the call through the Call Logger app,
When the call logging is completed,
Then the session ends,
And the user is returned to the search module landing page.
Scenario: Record of call activity in 'My Activities' tab
Given the user has logged a call and ended the session,
When the user checks the 'My Activities' tab,
Then there is a record of the activity for that participant,
And the activity includes Date/Time, Duration, Customer Name, Client Name, Plan ID,
And the activities are ordered from newest to oldest based on the Date/Time stamp.
Scenario: Consistency of activity details with call information
Given a call has been logged and the activity recorded,
When the user views the details of the activity in the 'My Activities' tab,
Then the details such as Customer Name, Client Name, and Plan ID match those from the call,
And the Date/Time and Duration accurately reflect the call's timing and length.
