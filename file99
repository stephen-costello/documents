As a user,
I want to see the customer name matching the participant banner, displayed in all capital letters and as a clickable link.

Scenario: Customer name matches the participant banner
Given the user is viewing the activities table,
When the table displays the customer name,
Then the customer name in the table matches exactly with the customer name on the participant banner.
Scenario: Customer name displayed in all capital letters
Given the user is viewing the activities table,
When the table displays the customer name,
Then the customer name is displayed in all capital letters,
And the text is in black.
Scenario: Customer name is a clickable link
Given the user is viewing the activities table,
When the table displays the customer name,
Then the customer name is underlined indicating it is a clickable link.
Scenario: Mouse icon change on hover over customer name
Given the user is viewing the activities table,
When the user hovers the mouse over a customer name,
Then the mouse icon changes to indicate that the customer name is interactive (e.g., changes to a hand pointer).
