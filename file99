As a user,
I want to have toggle options for 'Last 2 days' and 'Last 7 days' in the 'My Activities' tab of the search module.

Background:
Given the user is on the 'My Activities' tab in the search module

Scenario: Display of toggle options
Given the user navigates to the 'My Activities' tab,
Then the user sees two toggles prefixed with 'View:' text,
And 'Last 2 days()' toggle is visible on the right,
And 'Last 7 days()' toggle is also visible on the right,
And the number of activities for each view is displayed to the right of each toggle name.
Scenario: Default state of toggles
Given the user navigates to the 'My Activities' tab,
Then neither 'Last 2 days()' nor 'Last 7 days()' toggles are selected by default.
Scenario: Select 'Last 2 days' view
When the user clicks on the 'Last 2 days()' toggle,
Then the 'Last 2 days()' toggle turns green,
And the 'Last 7 days()' toggle remains inactive,
And only the activities from the last 2 days are displayed.
Scenario: Select 'Last 7 days' view
When the user clicks on the 'Last 7 days()' toggle,
Then the 'Last 7 days()' toggle turns green,
And the 'Last 2 days()' toggle remains inactive,
And only the activities from the last 7 days are displayed.
Scenario: Toggle between views
Given the 'Last 2 days()' toggle is selected,

When the user clicks on the 'Last 7 days()' toggle,

Then the 'Last 7 days()' toggle turns green,

And the 'Last 2 days()' toggle turns inactive,

And only the activities from the last 7 days are displayed.

Given the 'Last 7 days()' toggle is selected,

When the user clicks on the 'Last 2 days()' toggle,

Then the 'Last 2 days()' toggle turns green,

And the 'Last 7 days()' toggle turns inactive,

And only the activities from the last 2 days are displayed.
