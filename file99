Feature: Search Users in CRM System ADE
Objective: Ensure that the CRM system ADE can handle searches for users without a person identifier of MID correctly, showing a 'participant banner' instead of a 'System Error'.

Background:
Given the CRM system ADE is operational
And I am logged in with sufficient privileges to search for users

Scenario 1: Search for a User with a Person Identifier of MID
Given a user exists with a person identifier of MID
When I search for this user in the CRM system ADE
Then the system displays the user's details including the person identifier of MID
Scenario 2: Search for a User without a Person Identifier of MID
Given a user exists without a person identifier of MID
When I search for this user in the CRM system ADE
Then the system displays the 'participant banner' for the user without showing a 'System Error'
Scenario 3: Search for a Non-Existent User
Given a user does not exist in the CRM database
When I search for this non-existent user in the CRM system ADE
Then the system displays a message indicating that the user could not be found
Scenario 4: Perform a Blank Search
Given the search query is blank
When I execute the search in the CRM system ADE
Then the system prompts me to enter a search query
Scenario 5: Search for a User with a Blank Person Identifier of MID After the Fix
Given a user exists and the person identifier of MID can be blank
When I search for this user in the CRM system ADE
Then the system displays the 'participant banner' without any errors
