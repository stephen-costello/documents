As a user,
I want to be able to log each call and end each session in sequence, ensuring all interactions are captured in 'My Activities'.

Scenario: Logging multiple calls in sequence
Given the user receives a call and is in a session,
And another call comes in before the first call is logged and the session is ended,
When the user ends the first session but does not immediately log the call,
And then ends the second session,
Then the user must log the first call,
And subsequently log the second call.
Scenario: Accurate record of multiple activities in 'My Activities'
Given the user has received and ended sessions for two consecutive calls,
When the user logs both calls in sequence as per the system's requirement,
Then the user has a record of both activities in the 'My Activities' tab,
And each activity entry includes Date/Time, Duration, Customer Name, Client Name, Plan ID,
And the activities are ordered from newest to oldest based on the Date/Time stamp.
Scenario: Ensuring no loss of call information between sessions
Given multiple calls have been received and sessions initiated,
When the calls stack up due to the user not getting a chance to log each call immediately,
Then the system ensures no loss of information for each call,
And prompts the user to log each call in the order they were received and sessions ended.
Scenario: Maintaining sequential integrity of call logs
Given the user is managing multiple calls in a busy queue,
When the user completes a session and moves to log the call,
Then the system presents the call logging interface for each call in the sequence they were received and ended,
And ensures that the user can accurately log details for each call before proceeding to the next.
