As a user,
I want to see each activity recorded with a date and time stamp in a specific format and order.

Scenario: Correct date and time format for each activity
Given the user has activities recorded,
When the user views the activities in the table,
Then each activity's date is displayed in the "MM/DD/YYYY" format,
And each activity's time is displayed in the "HH:MM:SS AM/PM" format, all times in EST.
Scenario: Activities are ordered by date and time from newest to oldest
Given the user has multiple activities recorded,
When the user views the activities in the table,
Then the activities are ordered with the most recent date and time at the top of the table,
And activities follow in descending order towards the oldest at the bottom.
Scenario: Displaying activities with the correct time zone
Given the user is viewing the activities table,
When the activities have different recorded times,
Then all displayed times are in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone,
And the time zone is clearly indicated either as part of the time format or elsewhere in the table for user awareness.
