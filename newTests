Note: In these test cases, we are verifying that the API responds with a 200 status code for each of the five different options of the "FID-USER-HEADER" header. Please ensure that the request body contains the appropriate data for each test and that the response data is valid for further validation.

Please adapt these test cases based on your API's requirements and specifications. Also, consider adding additional test cases to cover different scenarios related to the use of the "FID-USER-HEADER" header and possible edge cases for thorough testing.
